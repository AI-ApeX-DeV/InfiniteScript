    "- note that char in java has 2 bytes unlike 1 byte in c++\n",
    "- There is a byte keyword in java which only takes 1 byte \n",
    "- in c++ you have to use static_cast<int>(variablename) for explicit conversion of data types but can be done implicitely as well but in case of java only explicit conversion is allowed and that is done through this syntax (int)variablename\n",
    "- object is created in heap and the variables declared in object are in heap, also the functions declared in class are in stack and nor in heap but the function decleration will be in heap\n",
    "-  static block is executed only once even if we create many objects for a class\n",
    "- constructor as the same name as that of the class name is used to initialiize. note that the constructor gets executed every time the oject is created and used \n",
    "- note that the static block gets executed first and then the constructor gets executed \n",
    "- class.forname(classname) -> this is used to intitialize the class and load the static class\n",
    "- java is good at memory management, because suppose if we  have 2 strings s1 and s2 then if navin name is stored in both the strings then in memory there is only one navin and both the variables points to them\n",
    "- sting buffer and string builder\n",
    "- string buffer is thread safe and string builder is not \n",
    "- when you type Calc  a= new Calc();, here a is a reference varaible, instead of this you can also just write new Calc(), this will simply create a obj in heap but you cannot use it again\n",
    "-  method overrinding in case of multiple inheritance, when we create a method with the same name in class a and b and if we create a obj of class b then the method of class b will get executed and if not found in b then if found in a then method of a gets executed\n",
    "- in java we use final keyword instead of const which we use in c++ and other programming language\n",
    "- when a class is final, no one can extend it\n",
    "- when a method is final, no one can override it \n",
    "- polymorphism can be runtime (method overriding) and compile time (method overloading)\n",
    "- class type casting also works in case of java for eg A a = (A) new B()  -> here both upcasting and downcasting is possible \n",
    "- abstract method and abstract class are used to define methods which we are not going to declare in the parent class but in the child class\n",
    "- Note: abstract method can only be declared in a abstract class\n",
    "- Note: if the parent abstract class has 2 asbtract methods then the child class must declare those methods else error would occur\n",
    "- Note: we cannot create object of a abstract class, we can create obj of a concrete class only, a concrete class is a child class which is not anstract\n",
    "- if we declare a class B in class A then in order to create a obj of B we have to do A.B obj = obj.new B() \n",
    "  - if there is a static method then we can declare the same by this syntax A.B obj = new A.B()\n",
    "  - Also note that static can be used only for inner class and not a outer class\n",
